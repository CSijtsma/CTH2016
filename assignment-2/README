To run script, install commander, chance and word-wrap

Description: Code which, when running, will print a brief, randomly generated letter from a king to his subordinates. 
The letter will contain a salutation, a core of 5 sentences with the same build, 
and a randomly selected ending with a choice of two possible endings.

EDIT:
Uploaded a second version of Kingsrequest.js (Kingsrequest2.js), which has a slight modification to solve a problem the scrupt had
before, where it would display randomly picked words as "undefined". This happened after correspondence with the teacher.
